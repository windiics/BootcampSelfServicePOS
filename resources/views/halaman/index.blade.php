        <h3><span style="color:#78290f">My Little Story&#9749</span></h3>
            <p>
                When the beginning of the learning period in class X SMK, I got a question that actually I often hear and often I answer, but never thought about it further. The question is: <strong><em>"What do you want to be?"</em></strong>. Simple question, but still makes me think many times to answer it.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I remember, that question often came out since I was a child.
                In the past, I answered it originally. Today I answer that I want to be a Doctor, tomorrow I answer I want to be a Stewardess, the next day I answer I want to be a Designer, the next day I answer I want to be an Artist, and so on. The difference with now, I answer it with more caution. Because, determining my goals is one way to find my true identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to be a writer. Why? Because it is related to me who likes to write. Writing has become a necessity for me. By writing, our brain is not too fulfilled with many thoughts, because it has been poured through writing. Besides that, I also like reading, especially if the reading is a novel.
